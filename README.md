#### Quiz Oct 28

Time: 11.05 - 11.35 a.m. / 12.05 - 12.35 p.m.

Topics:

- Distributions (normal distribution, standard deviation)

  slides 2a,  hw4

- Relationships (regression line, correlation coefficient)

  slides 2b, hw5

#### Normal Distributions

Compute the standard deviation of $1,2,3,3,4,5$

- Compute mean

- Compute the sum of squares

- Divide by $n-1$ for the variance

- Take the square roots for the standard deviation

The 68-95-99.7 rule and its applications. This applies to normal distributions only. (exercise3 in hw4)

#### Relationships

Linear Regression -

- Describe the relationship of two variables
- Can use to predict

Correlation coefficients - 

- sign: denotes whether the variables are positively or negatively correlated;

  ​		  always the same as the sign of the slope of the regression line

- value: how close dots are from the regression line;

  ​            has nothing to do with the value of the slope.

#### Probability Models

Definitions:

- Sample space
- Sample size
- Probability of each outcomes



Example: 

- A coin flip
- A die roll
- Three coin flips



We flip three coins (one by one). What is the sample space?

Denote event $E$ as follows: at least a Head in the first two rolls. What is $\mathbb P(E)$?



Now we consider a more complex scenario: 

We roll five dice (one by one). What is the sample space?

Denote event $E$ as follows: We get a 6 in the first roll $\underline {or}$ we get anything but 6 in the second roll. What is $\mathbb P(E)$?

We may simplify using the model by considering the first two rolls only. What is the sample space now?



Alternatively, we may also apply the formula $\mathbb P(A\cup B) = \mathbb P(A)+\mathbb P(B)- \mathbb P(A\cap B)$

Event $A$: We get a 6 in the first roll. What is $\mathbb P(A)$?

Event $B$: We do get a 6 in the second roll. What is $\mathbb P(B)$?

Event $A\cap B$: We get a 6 in the first roll $\underline {and}$ we get anything but 6 in the second roll.  What is $\mathbb P(A\cap B)$?

Event $A\cup B$: We get a 6 in the first roll $\underline {or}$ we get anything but 6 in the second roll. What is $\mathbb P(A\cup B)$?



There are four boxes, denoting as $A, B, C, D$, in a row. Each will be colored as Red, Green, or Blue, 

with equal probability  $\displaystyle \frac13$ (colors are reusable). 

Denote event $E$ as follows: $A$ is in Red and and $B$ is not in Red. What is $\mathbb P(E)$?

We may simplify using the model by considering the first two rolls only. What is the sample space now?

Alternatively, we may also apply the formula $\mathbb P(A\cup B) = \mathbb P(A)+\mathbb P(B)- \mathbb P(A\cap B)$
